#Script to provision server users in the CloudPassage API
This script allows you to provision users on managed nodes using the CloudPassage API.  If the user already exists, the script will request a password reset for that account.

##Before We Begin
Please have a look at the config.conf file.  You will need to set your clientid and clientsecret or the script simply won't work.
Command line execution looks like this: 
provisionusers.py -u USER -g GROUP -s SERVERGROUP
You can omit anything here as long as it's configured in the config.conf file.

###Step by Step
Download all the files here into the same location and make sure that provisionusers.py is executable.
Edit config.conf to set your API key and secret, as well as any other values you need.  Username, groups, and server groups are overridden by command line arguments
